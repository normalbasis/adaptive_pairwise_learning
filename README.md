# Pairwise Learning with Adaptive Online Gradient Descent

This repository contains the code accompanying the paper "Pairwise Learning with Adaptive Online Gradient Descent" by Tao Sun, Qingsong Wang, Yunwen Lei, Dongsheng Li and Bao Wang.

## Introduction

Our algorithm is implemented in the folder "alg" with `auc_fifoada_hinge.py`, `auc_fifoada_loglink.py`, and `auc_fifoada_square.py` being the same algorithm with different loss functions.

This repository is still under construction.
